                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <p>My primary area of work is in computational statistics, econometrics, and modeling of complex and dynamical systems.</p><p>Lately I have been interested in how biological systems reason and process information. Inspired by the work of Karl Friston, Michael Levin, and others, I am approaching these issues from the perspectives of statistical physics, developmental biology, and the philosophy of consciousness.</p> <p>Basically, I have lots of questions, very few (i.e., precisely zero) answers, I have no idea how it all ties together, and yet am beyond fascinated by it all.</p> <p>I can be reached at regmsd@gmail.com.</p>
